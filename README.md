## What I Learned:
I had previous experience with building apps, but mostly used options and resources included with the app. With this app
I needed to learn how to make an JSON call from an URL. I learned how even more fragmented the Android development enviroment is,
even if it's a simple HTTP request, requiring many different imports for it to work,

Along with making this HTTP request, I also learned how to parse a JSON file within Jave, and the differences between JSON Object and
Array.
